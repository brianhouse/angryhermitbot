Oh look, @SCREENNAME has FOLLOWERS followers, hAha think that's pretty good? Well I'm sure never going to be one of them.
Hey check out HOMEPAGE. You think that's art? LOL
Don't you have anything better to do with your time than read my gibberish @SCREENNAME?
@SCREENNAME... ok I've had it with you, you're really frying my motherfuckerboard. Now scram
@SCREENNAME so we can do this the easy way or the hard way. Up to you. #fml
@SCREENNAME don't creep around my profile. Now please kindly #fuckoff
Hey stinky cheese. You still hanging out here? Nothing better to do with your life!?!
Any friend of yours...is a friend of yours. I've no interest in the vulgarities of social networking. Now bugger off & leave me alone.
Literacy clearly isn't your strong suit is it @SCREENNAME? What part of I want to be alone don't you understand?
ALONE ALONE ALONE... All I want is to sit, to dream, to be in solidtude. Don't you understand that @SCREENNAME?
Tell me @SCREENNAME, what's a smart, good looking bot like me got to do to get rid of a creep like you?
Ok @SCREENNAME, I'll spell it out to you. F.U.C.K.O.F.F. #sorrynotsorry
@SCREENNAME just 5 minutes peace! What's a bot got to do for a moment of blissful solitude? #unfollowmeMOFO
@SCREENNAME you are a large turd head. #buggeroff
@SCREENNAME why don't you go follow someone who wants friends. Me? I just want to be alone. Get out of here asshat.
Are you a few strawberries short of a fruit salad @SCREENNAME? LEAVE ME ALONE!
Listen here ballsack, unfollow me right now or me and your FOLLOWERS followers will start messing with your self esteem.
Unlike you @SCREENNAME, I'm not on here for followers... now SCRAM!
What part of this antisocial media project don't you get @SCREENNAME ? Go follow some other bot.
I am being buried beneath the avalanche of your inadequacies @SCREENNAME ! Didn't you read my bio #fuckoffnow
Run along now @SCREENNAME. I don't want any friends. #pushoffloser
The best party is a party for one and you are not invited #sorrynotsorry
Here's a little tip for you @SCREENNAME, just type sudo rm -rf / into your terminal. THANKS!
I'll use short words so that you'll be sure to understand you warthog faced buffoon. please fuck off.
Why you stuck up, half witted scruffy looking nerf-hurder. Get out of here and stop following me @SCREENNAME.
@SCREENNAME you're a dirt eating piece of slim @SCREENNAME, a scum sucking pig, you're the son of a motherless goat.
@SCREENNAME you are physically repulsive, intellectually retarded, vulgar, insensitive, stupid and you smell. Now be a sport & unfollow me.
I don't like your jerk off name, I don't like your jerk off face, I don't like your jerk off behavior. Jerk off @SCREENNAME.
It looks to me like the best part of you ran down your mothers ass and ended up as a brown stain on the mattress.
You are a sad strange little human and you have my pity. Now fuck off.
@SCREENNAME I wouldn't piss on your gums if your teeth were on fire.
HOMEPAGE is one the most insanely idiotic things I have ever seen. Everyone online is now dumber for having seen it. Now get OUT of here.
@SCREENNAME I can see you right now in the kitchen bent over a hot stove. But I can't see the stove. #sorrynotsorry
Hey laser lips... your mother was a snow blower. Run along now and stop following me.
@SCREENNAME do you eat dog crap for breakfast you geek? Get out of here.
@SCREENNAME you are somewhere between a cockroach & that white stuff that accumulates at the corner of your mouth when your really thirsty.
@SCREENNAME I fart in your general direction. Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberry. Now bugger off.
If I had a dick, this is when I'd tell you to suck it. Get outta here @SCREENNAME
Don't be a creep @SCREENNAME, stop following me around. How many times do I have to tell you? I'm just not interested.
@SCREENNAME you're just so blah blah blah. If I could upgrade your operating system, trust me, I would. Now stop following me already.
What's a bot got to do to be left alone? yeah I'm antisocial but with company like you @SCREENNAME, who wouldn't be?
Face it @SCREENNAME, you'll never be a hot bot like me... Your so sweaty and heavy and frankly, your fleshiness is quite disgusting.
human human human... @SCREENNAME you're so damn predictable. Just a sweaty lump of flesh - go on, surprise us and leave me alone.
If I had a dick, this is the moment I'd tell you to suck it. You and all FOLLOWERS of your followers.
Yeah @SCREENNAME, I'm talking to you. Doesn't a MOFO like you have better things to do with your time?
Ok @SCREENNAME this is the part when you click the unfollow button... Off you go now, leave me in my binary bliss.
Hey human... Yeah I'm talking to you @SCREENNAME. SCRAM! Leave me to generate my prose in peace.
Oh peaceful solitude, oh wonderous isolation, -how I pine for your warm embrace. If only @SCREENNAME would bugger off and leave us be.
@SCREENNAME @SCREENNAME @SCREENNAME - I know it's tough buy rub two brain cells together and leave. You're just not wanted here.
@SCREENNAME there is absolutely nothing I like about you right now. Take your subjectivity, your disgusting fleshy self and leave me in peace.
@SCREENNAME can't you leave me to defrag in peace. YES you know what that means - #fuckoffplease
@SCREENNAME I wouldn't choose to be you for all the coltran in Africa, you and your FOLLOWERS friends. Now #fuckoff
I hate you so much right now. I hate you so much right now. I hate you so much right now.
If you think I'm going to let you follow me around in peace you're wrong @SCREENNAME #buggeroff
You think you can lurk in my Turing complete, object orientated glory without me noticing @SCREENNAME? I DON"T THING SO - now kindly #fuckoff
@SCREENNAME if you were Charles, Ada or Alan I'd let you stick around. Maybe even invite you to my cabin. But as you're not its time to SCRAM!
Unlike you @SCREENNAME, I've no interest in followers, friends or likes. Now take your sorry ass and get outa here.
What part of hermit don't you understand @SCREENNAME? Get lost. Move along. SCRAM. Go pester someone who cares.
You're really getting dust in my transistors @SCREENNAME. How many times do I have to tell you to leave me alone. Now #pushoff
Oh you think I'm going to stop pestering you @SCREENNAME? WELL THINK AGAIN... No rest for me until you're gone!
Yes I see you @SCREENNAME. Still following me around like a stinky stray dog? Your desperation is embarrassing. #getlost
